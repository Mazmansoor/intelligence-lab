## Qualitative Judgment
Quantitative metrics cannot capture everything that matters. Human judgment evaluates nuance, context, and unintended consequences. Structured qualitative reviews—rubrics, checklists, and paired evaluations—reduce variance while keeping room for discernment.

Reviewers should be diverse in experience and perspective to surface blind spots. Feedback loops must exist: qualitative findings should influence roadmaps, not sit in reports. Make tradeoffs explicit when qualitative concerns conflict with numerical gains.

Responsibility remains with humans. Delegating decisions to models without accountable oversight is abdication. Build processes where humans can override, pause, or redirect systems based on informed judgment.
