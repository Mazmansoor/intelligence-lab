## When Metrics Fail
Metrics fail when they are gamed, when they ignore externalities, or when they measure proxies disconnected from real outcomes. Goodhart’s Law is not a slogan; it is a warning that optimization can hollow out intent.

Detect failure by watching for divergence between metric gains and user outcomes, by auditing edge cases, and by stress-testing with adversarial inputs. Include canary metrics that signal harm or misuse even if they reduce headline numbers.

When metrics fail, pause and reassess. Revisit the objective, adjust data collection, and involve stakeholders who experience the system’s impact. The goal is not to invent new numbers but to restore alignment between measurement and mission.
