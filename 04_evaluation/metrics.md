## Metrics
Metrics quantify, but they also shape behavior. Choose metrics that reflect outcomes, not vanity. Define what good looks like, how it is measured, and what tradeoffs are acceptable. Every metric should have an owner and a review cadence.

Metrics miss nuance. Aggregate numbers can hide distributional harms, long-tail failures, and user experience issues. Pair quantitative measures with qualitative review, and include leading indicators for drift or misuse.

When metrics conflict, decide deliberately which to prioritize and under what conditions to pause deployments. Document the rationale so future teams understand the boundaries of acceptable degradation.
