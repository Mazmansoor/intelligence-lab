# Intelligence Lab

A long-term workspace for understanding, designing, and evaluating intelligent systems.

This repository exists before code.
It is where problems are framed, constraints are made explicit, and systems earn the right to be built.

## What This Is
- A thinking and design space
- A record of judgment
- A place to slow down before execution

## What This Is Not
- Not a product repo
- Not a demo gallery
- Not a framework showcase
- Not a tutorial

## How This Repo Is Used
1. Start here to frame problems and design systems
2. Only then create an execution repo using ai-app-template
3. Link implementations back here
4. Record what broke, what changed, and what endured

## Structure Overview
- `00_orientation`: Purpose, principles, and guardrails before any deep dive.
- `01_foundations`: Base concepts that shape system thinking: computation, probability, optimization, information.
- `02_models`: Perspectives on model families, their limits, and when to use them.
- `03_systems`: System-level components, integrations, and typical failure patterns.
- `04_evaluation`: Ways to judge systems, both quantitative and qualitative.
- `05_production`: Considerations for shipping and sustaining intelligent systems.
- `06_case_studies`: How to learn from others through repos, papers, and postmortems.
- `07_original_systems`: Designed systems that earned implementation elsewhere.
- `08_reflections`: Evolving beliefs, mistakes, and open questions.

## Core Principle
Intelligence only matters when it survives scale, complexity, and consequence.
