# intelligence-lab

A long-term workspace for understanding, designing, and evaluating intelligent systems.

This repository exists **before** code.
It is where problems are framed, constraints are made explicit, and systems earn the right to be built.

## What This Is

**Intelligence Lab** is a thinking and design space for:

- Problem framing before solutioning  
- System design under real-world constraints  
- Failure analysis and evaluation  
- Capturing judgment that compounds over time  

It is intentionally slow, reflective, and durable.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a product repository  
- Not a demo gallery  
- Not a tutorial collection  
- Not a place for production code  

Code lives elsewhere.  
Understanding lives here.

## How This Repository Is Used

Every serious system follows this sequence:

1. **Start here**
   - Define the problem
   - Identify constraints
   - Design the system
   - Anticipate failure modes
   - Define evaluation criteria

2. **Only then build**
   - Instantiate an execution repo using `ai-app-template`
   - Implement agents, prompts, pipelines, and infrastructure

3. **Link back**
   - Each built system links to its implementation repo
   - Post-implementation learnings are recorded here

This keeps thinking and execution separate—but connected.
