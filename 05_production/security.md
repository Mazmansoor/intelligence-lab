## Security
Security is about containment and trust. Intelligent systems expand attack surfaces through data intake, model behavior, and automation. Assume adversaries will probe prompts, abuse APIs, and seek leakage of private data.

Principles: least privilege, auditability, and defense in depth. Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and monitor for anomalous use. Treat model behavior as untrusted: apply filters, rate limits, and isolation before actions reach external systems.

Incident readiness matters. Maintain playbooks, practice drills, and ensure logging captures enough context without storing sensitive material unnecessarily. Security work is ongoing; each new capability requires another threat review.
