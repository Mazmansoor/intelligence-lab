## Cost Models
Cost shapes behavior. Systems that ignore cost invite runaway usage and fragile economics. Build explicit cost models that link resource consumption to value: compute per request, storage per record, human review per decision.

Track costs over time and per feature. Forecast scenarios: growth, failure, abuse. Include hidden costs such as on-call load, compliance obligations, and user support. Use budgets and alerts to prevent surprises.

Design choices should reflect cost awareness. Caching, batching, and model selection all trade money for performance or accuracy. Make the tradeoffs visible and reversible.
