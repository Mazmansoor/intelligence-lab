## Observability
Observability reveals how systems behave under real conditions. Logs, metrics, and traces should tell a coherent story: what happened, where, and why. Instrumentation is not a bolt-on; it is part of design.

Focus on signals that indicate user impact: latency distributions, error budgets, saturation, and unusual input patterns. Sampling strategies must balance cost with insight. Blind spots invite surprises during incidents.

During stress, clarity outranks completeness. Build dashboards that answer the first questions responders ask. Keep runbooks updated with what to check, how to mitigate, and when to escalate. Observability is successful when on-call engineers can regain control quickly.
