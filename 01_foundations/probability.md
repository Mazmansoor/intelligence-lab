## Probability
Uncertainty is the default state of real systems. Probability provides a language to express belief without pretending to know. Confidence should be earned through calibration: repeated prediction, feedback, and adjustment. Overconfident systems hide risks until they fail catastrophically; underconfident systems waste opportunity and human attention.

Probabilistic thinking forces explicit acknowledgment of priors and likelihoods. It reminds us that rare events still happen, correlations mislead, and tails dominate in complex environments. Metrics like entropy, variance, and error bars are not ornaments—they guide decisions about when to automate, when to escalate, and when to ask for more data.

Every probability estimate should be tied to a verification loop. Without measurement against ground truth, probability collapses into numerically flavored opinion. Systems should track calibration drift over time and adjust thresholds as distributions shift.
