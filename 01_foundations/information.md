## Information
Information is signal captured under constraints. It is always entangled with loss: compression removes detail, sampling misses events, and encoding choices privilege some interpretations over others. Treating data as truth ignores its journey and the incentives of those who produced it.

Signal-to-noise ratios govern what systems can learn. More data does not guarantee more meaning; sometimes it amplifies noise. Curating data, annotating provenance, and measuring uncertainty are part of system design, not afterthoughts. When meaning is ambiguous, systems should prefer to ask for clarification rather than guess confidently.

Information architecture must also consider decay. Data grows stale, context drifts, and historical artifacts calcify bias. Retention policies and refresh cycles keep representations aligned with reality and prevent models from anchoring to outdated patterns.
