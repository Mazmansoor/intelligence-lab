## Optimization
Optimization is a tool that narrows attention. It crystallizes an objective and pushes systems toward it, sometimes past the point of prudence. Local optima tempt teams because they are reachable; global optima remain speculative. The act of choosing an objective is itself a judgment call that should be revisited as context evolves.

Optimization distorts intent when proxies stand in for outcomes. Metrics like click-through or latency are easy to measure and easy to game. A disciplined system makes the proxy explicit, tracks its failures, and sets guardrails to prevent runaway behavior. Regular audits should question whether the optimized metric still aligns with the mission.

Not everything should be optimized. Some processes benefit from slack and redundancy. Introducing headroom allows systems to absorb surprises, while over-tightening creates fragility. Knowing when to stop is as important as knowing how to push.
