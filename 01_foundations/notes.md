## Notes
- Think in terms of flows, not snapshots. Systems live in time; diagrams should show movement, not only boxes.
- Humans remain part of the control loop. Automation should reveal when it needs help instead of pretending autonomy.
- Latency discipline is moral: slow feedback hides errors and delays learning.
- Defaults are commitments. Choose conservative defaults that fail safe and can be tuned with evidence.
- The map is not the terrain. Metrics and models are representations; check reality regularly.
