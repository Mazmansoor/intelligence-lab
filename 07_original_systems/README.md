## Original Systems
Systems appear here only after design is complete. Each system folder must include:
- problem.md
- constraints.md
- system_design.md
- evaluation.md
- links_to_implementation.md

This area is for committed designs that have earned implementation. Drafts belong elsewhere until the reasoning is complete and defensible.
