## Papers
Reading papers critically means separating insight from marketing. Start with the problem statement and baseline comparisons. Check whether the data is public, whether ablations isolate contributions, and whether evaluation covers edge cases.

Note what the authors choose to omit: deployment constraints, cost, and failure handling. Replicability matters; favor works that release code and data, but still verify assumptions before adoption.

Summaries here should capture methods, limitations, and applicability to our contexts. Keep a running list of questions to revisit as systems evolve.
