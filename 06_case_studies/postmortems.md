## Postmortems
Postmortems turn failure into future protection. Focus on causes, contributing factors, and signals that were missed. Avoid blame; emphasize systemic fixes and ownership of follow-up actions.

Capture timeline, impact, detection, response, and remediation. Include what would have reduced time to detection or mitigation. Revisit postmortems after fixes land to verify effectiveness.

Patterns across incidents reveal structural weaknesses. Track them and adjust architecture, training, or processes accordingly. The goal is fewer repeats and faster recovery.
