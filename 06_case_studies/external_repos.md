## External Repos
Studying other repositories is about understanding decisions, not copying code. Look for architecture choices, failure handling, and evolution over time. Read commit history and issues to see what hurt and how it was fixed.

Extract principles, not patterns. Ask why a design worked in its context and what assumptions it carried. Translate lessons into checklists or constraints for future builds here.

Document findings with links, but keep this lab free of code. The goal is to internalize judgment, not to clone implementations.
