## Open Questions
- How to measure groundedness in generative systems without manual review of every output?
- What governance model best balances rapid iteration with safety in multi-team environments?
- When does retrieval-first architecture beat larger models, and how do we detect the crossover point?
- How to budget compute adaptively based on uncertainty rather than fixed quotas?
- What forms of user feedback are most reliable for improving model behavior without inviting manipulation?
