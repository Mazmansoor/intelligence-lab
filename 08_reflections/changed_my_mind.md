## Changed My Mind
- Human review scales further than expected when supported by good tooling. The bottleneck was clarity, not headcount.
- Simpler models paired with strong data validation often outperform complex architectures in production stability.
- Generative models are most valuable as drafting partners, not decision-makers, especially where accountability is required.
- Strict upfront specifications slowed early velocity but prevented larger rewrites later.
- Incident drills felt performative until a real outage proved their worth; practice reduced chaos.
