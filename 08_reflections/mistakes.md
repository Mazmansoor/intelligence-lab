## Mistakes
- Shipping without clear rollback paths. Confidence is not a substitute for reversibility.
- Trusting benchmarks as proxies for user value. Numbers impressed, users churned.
- Ignoring data provenance. Small schema shifts cascaded into silent model drift.
- Over-automating early. Manual steps would have revealed edge cases faster.
- Deferring documentation. Memory faded and context had to be relearned at cost.
