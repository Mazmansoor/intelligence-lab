## Tradeoffs
- Accuracy vs. latency: Faster responses improved engagement but masked subtle errors that appeared later.
- Automation vs. control: Increasing autonomy reduced operational toil but made failure analysis harder.
- Personalization vs. privacy: Better relevance competed with the obligation to minimize data retention.
- Centralization vs. team autonomy: Shared infrastructure accelerated delivery until divergent needs created bottlenecks.
- Novelty vs. stability: Pushing new models kept capabilities sharp while increasing regression risk.
