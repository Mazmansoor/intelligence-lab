## Memory
Memory systems balance retention with relevance. Short-term memory enables context within a session; long-term memory provides continuity across sessions. Without curation, memory becomes cluttered and slows retrieval.

Forgetting is a feature. Prune or decay entries based on utility, freshness, and risk. Versioning and timestamps let systems resolve conflicts and understand the lineage of facts. Human-in-the-loop review helps when automated policies cannot judge significance.

Distortion occurs when memories are merged or summarized without preserving provenance. Keep raw artifacts when feasible and make summaries reversible by linking back to sources. Memory should serve current decisions, not accumulate trivia.
